# Fundamentals
## Bags, queues, and stacks

---
+ LIFO: last in first out
+ FIFO: first in first out

---
three data *types/structures*:
+ bags
+ FIFO queue
+ LIFO stack
  evaluation example

---
three features:
+ generics
+ autoboxing
+ iterable collection

---
>algorithm1.1
>Pushdown stack: using interface

---
Linked lists: a new data structure  
data structures:
+ array: sequential
+ linked list: linked allocation

## Analysis of algorithms
Mathematical model
+ Tilde approximations
+ Approximate running time
+ cost model

---
Order-of-growth classifications
+ constant
+ logarithmic
+ linear
+ linearithmic
+ quadratic
+ cubic
+ exponential
