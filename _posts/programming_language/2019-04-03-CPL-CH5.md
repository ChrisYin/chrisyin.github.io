# Pointers and Addresses

Precedence:

1. *ip += 1
increments what ip points to.

2. ++*ip  == (*ip)++
from right to left

# Pointers and Function Arguments

If you want to change to pointer's value, you should transfer the pointer of that pointer.

# Pointers and Array

# Address Arithmetic

using malloc should add forces type conversion ahead.

# Character Pointers and Functions

# Pointer Arrays; Pointer to Pointers

declaration: int *pt[N]

# Multi-dimensional Arrays

declaration: int (*daytab)[N]

# Initialization of Pointer Arrays

# Pointers vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays

# Command-line Arguments

By convention, argv[0] is the name by which the program was invoked.

# Pointer to functions

declaration: int (*comp)(void *, void *)

# Complicated Declaration
