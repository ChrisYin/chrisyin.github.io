# File Descriptor

A small non-negative integer called a file descriptor.

0,1,2: standard input, standard output and standard error.

# Low Level I/O - Read and Write

+ int n_read = read(int fd, char *buf, int n);
+ int n_write = write(int fd, char *buf, int n);

# Open, Create, Close, Unlink

File permission: read, write and execute access for the owner of the file, for the owner's group, and for all others.

# Random Access - Lseek

Input and output are normally sequential.

+ long lseek(int fd, long offset, int origin);

# Example - An implementation of Fopen and Getc

# Example - Listing Directories

# Example - A Storage Allocator
