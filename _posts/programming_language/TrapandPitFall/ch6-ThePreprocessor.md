# The preprocessor

## Space matter in macro definition

## Macros are not functions

+ add parentheses
+ side effects: appear only once

## Macros are not statements

add commas??

Please use expressions to replace statements in Macros

## Macros are not type definitions

Use *typedef* as type definition
