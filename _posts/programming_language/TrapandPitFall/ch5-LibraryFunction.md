# Library functions

## *getchar* returns an integer

## Updating a sequential file

An input operation may never directly follow an output operation or vice versa without an intervening call to *fseek*.

## Buffered output and memory allocation

After the main program has finished, as part of the cleaning up that the Library does before handing control to the OS. By that time, *buf* has already been freed.

## Using *errno* for error detection

如果函数返回值错误才去检查errno信息

## The signal function

保证丝杆signal函数尽可能的简单。
