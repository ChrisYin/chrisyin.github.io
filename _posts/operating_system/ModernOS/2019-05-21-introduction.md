# What is an Operating System?

## The Operating System as an Extended Machine

+ Easier to program than the underlying hardware.

## The Operating System as a Resource Manager

+ Time and Space Multiplexing

# History of Operating System

## Processors
+ registers
+ pipeline
+ Out of Order

## Memory

Hierarchy of layers
+ registers
+ cache
+ main memory
+ magnetic disk
+ magnetic tape

+ Device Controller
+ Device Driver

Three different ways to do IO
+ system call
+ interrupt
+ DMA

## Buses

x86 has eight buses: cache, local, memory, PCI, SCSI, USB, IDE and ISA.
